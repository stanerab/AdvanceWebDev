            <h4><strong>About this book</strong></h4>
            A Few Bad Men is the incredible true story of an elite team of U.S. Marines set up to take the fall for
            Afghanistan war crimes they did not commit and their leader who fought for the redemption of his men.
            Ambushed in Afghanistan and betrayed by their own leaders these elite Marines fought for their lives again,
            back home. A cross between A Few Good Men and American Sniper, this is the true story of an elite Marine
            special operations unit bombed by an IED and shot at during an Afghanistan ambush.
            <br><br>
            The Marine Commandos were falsely accused of gunning down innocent Afghan civilians following the ambush.
            The unit's leader, Maj. Fred Galvin, was summarily relieved of duty and his unit was booted from the combat
            zone. They were condemned by everyone, from the Afghan president to American generals. When Fox Company
            returned to America, Galvin and his captain were the targets of the first Court of Inquiry in the Marines in
            fifty years. “Fred Galvin is the real deal. His dramatic retelling of his experience as commander of Fox
            Company reads like a thriller, full of twists and turns, filled with unassuming heroes and deceitful
            villains.” Rob Lorenz, Producer/Director, American Sniper, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima,
            Mystic River, The Marksman “Fred Galvin has written a real page turne that demonstrates how politics
            permeates The Pentagon and posts abroad…I highly recommend this book. J.D. Hayworth, U.S. House of
            Representatives (Arizona), TV/Radio Host “This book is a must-read for every American who wants to know why,
            after twenty long years in Afghanistan, we did not win.
            <br><br>
            Jessie Jane Duff, USMC, Analyst, CNN and FOX “A Few Bad Men is a must-read story of valor, betrayal, and
            keeping the Marines' honor clean.” Jed Babbin, USAF Judge Advocate, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense,
            Journalist, National Review, Washington Post “An incredible account and history of the fighting spirit of
            the 'Marine Raiders' under fire and the relentless fourteen-year campaign by their leader to clear their
            names.” Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely, U.S. Army (Ret.), Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific Command
