            <h4><strong>About this book</strong></h4>
            Anthony Eden, who served as both Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, was one of the central political
            figures of the twentieth century. He had good looks, charm, a Military Cross from the Great War, an Oxford
            first and a secure parliamentary constituency from his mid-twenties.
            <br><br>
            He was Foreign Secretary at the age of 38, and the first British statesman to meet Hitler, Mussolini and
            Stalin. Eden's dramatic resignation from Neville Chamberlain's Cabinet in 1938, outlined here in the fullest
            detail yet, made an international impact.

            <br><br>
            This ground-breaking book examines his controversial life and tells the inside story of the Munich crisis
            (1938), the Geneva Conference (1954), Eden's battles with Churchill over the modernisation of the post-war
            Conservative Party and his rivalry with Butler and Macmillan in the early 1950s, culminating in a
            fascinating analysis of the Suez crisis.
