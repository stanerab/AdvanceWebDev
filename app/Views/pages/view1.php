            <h4><strong>About this book</strong></h4>
            From the time, many years ago, when Michael Palin first heard that his grandfather had a brother, Harry, who
            died in tragic circumstances, he was determined to find out more about him.
            <br><br>
            The quest that followed involved hundreds of hours of painstaking detective work. Michael dug out every bit
            of family gossip and correspondence he could. He studied every relevant official document. He tracked down
            what remained of his great-uncle Harry's diaries and letters, and pored over photographs of First World War
            battle scenes to see whether Harry appeared in any of them. He walked the route Harry took on that fatal,
            final day of his life amid the mud of northern France. And as he did so, a life that had previously existed
            in the shadows was revealed to him.
            <br><br>
            Great-Uncle Harry is an utterly compelling account of an ordinary man who led an extraordinary life. A blend
            of biography, history, travelogue and personal memoir this is Michael Palin at his very finest.
